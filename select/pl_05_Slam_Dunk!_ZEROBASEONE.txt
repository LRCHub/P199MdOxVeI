Got basic skills
The kind that thrill
My moves are hot
Can't block that shot
Watch me now- oh yeah
Check my style
I make you smile
Hang time reverse?
Just watch me work
CHORUS
Shack to chateau! watch me go
You want a big car
And you finally win it
Next week you're sleepin' in it
That's the game we play
And I plan on winnin'...
Slam dunk
Guaranteed to shock
I can't be stopped
Don't need no defense baby
I plays on top
CHORUS
So let the good times roll
My game is better than ever
Winners... they come and go
Legends... they're forever
CHORUS
